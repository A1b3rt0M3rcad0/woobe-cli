### Bind a Provider before the first Agent push

Create/register a public Provider descriptor with `spec.provider` (and optional
base URL); credentials belong to the destination, never the author YAML.

```sh
woobe provider list
woobe resources bind provider '@openai-main' CREDENTIAL_UUID
woobe agent '@support' create --yes
```

Binding verifies the credential is active, belongs to the current Project and
matches the Provider type. It is stored under private `.state`, scoped to API,
Workspace and Project. Repeating the same binding is safe; rebinding or assigning
the same native credential to a second local Provider is rejected. `--dry-run`
performs the read and validation without persisting. Providers captured by `pull`
already have this binding.
