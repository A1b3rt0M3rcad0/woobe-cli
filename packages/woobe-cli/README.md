# Woobe CLI

The native Woobe client, packaged for Linux, macOS and Windows on x64 and arm64.
Node.js 22 or newer is required for the npm launcher. Go is not required.

Run without a global installation:

```sh
npx --package=woobe-cli woobe version
npx --package=woobe-cli woobe help
```

Or install once:

```sh
npm install --global woobe-cli
woobe version
```

Pin an exact version for repeatable automation:

```sh
npx --package=woobe-cli@0.13.7 woobe version
```

The package contains all six native executables. Installation needs no lifecycle
scripts or external binary downloads; `npm install --ignore-scripts` works.
Arguments, stdin, output and exit codes pass directly to the native client.

## Connect your Workspace

In Woobe, open **Workspace settings → CLI Keys**, create a Control Key and save
the secret before closing the view. Create/select a connection and authenticate
with the masked prompt:

```sh
woobe context create woobe --api-url https://YOUR_WOOBE_API
woobe context use woobe
woobe auth login --cli-key
woobe agent list --output compact
```

The key discovers its Workspace and eligible Projects. A single eligible Project
is selected automatically; otherwise use `woobe context project select`.
Each connection retains its own protected key and Project selection.

The API URL is the backend URL. Project access comes from the key's explicit
grants. Runtime execution uses a separate Runtime Key.

For a terminal without Node, download the native archive from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/A1b3rt0M3rcad0/woobe-cli/releases).
See [installation and versioning](https://github.com/A1b3rt0M3rcad0/woobe-cli/blob/master/docs/INSTALLATION.md)
and the included `USAGE.md` for commands and credential handling.

The client is under active development. See
[implementation status](https://github.com/A1b3rt0M3rcad0/woobe-cli/blob/master/docs/STATUS.md)
for functional coverage and known limitations. Published versions are identified by their immutable tag/source manifest.


## Coding assistant integration

New CLI releases containing this feature embed the same portable assistant skill:

```sh
woobe skill install --agent codex
woobe skill install --agent claude
woobe skill status --agent codex,claude
```

Installation is offline and requires no extra npm package, Node.js, backend login
or development registry. Native `--project-dir` selects a local project;
`--agent codex-legacy` targets `.codex/skills`. `woobe-cli-skill` remains an
optional independent npm installer. See
[skill installation and host layouts](https://github.com/A1b3rt0M3rcad0/woobe-cli/blob/master/docs/AGENT_SKILL.md).
