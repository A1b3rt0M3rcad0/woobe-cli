# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Separate edited package structure from capture integrity with offline `package validate --structure-only`; retain integrity gates on transfers and coordinate help/assistant references (CLI 0.32.3+).
- Explain missing accepted Candidate bindings using bounded component diagnostics and recovery guidance.

- Correct completed Draft reconciliation, nested command errors and compact ASaC continuation identities.
- Distinguish absent/null fields, add read-only strict field projection, and preserve cloned display names independently of aliases.
- Add verified offline `package edit`/`seal` copies and align documentation and the bundled assistant skill (CLI 0.32.2+).

- Accept simple runtime YAML session/options names and retain legacy SDK spellings; reject unknown/conflicting fields instead of silently opening a new Session.

- Add offline exact-commit Git proofs and independently authorized Agent/Network Git attestation receipts, preserving original publication/deployment history. Coordinate help/docs/assistant references for CLI 0.32+.

- Fresh Agent/Network captures reuse the owner's canonical ASaC identity; reject a conflicting local UID without changing author files.

- Binding recovery accepts the empty checkpoint left by a completed ASaC write. Unresolved, malformed and partial checkpoints still block recovery before network access.

- Export authorized server-signed Agent/Network receipts, pin operator-confirmed instance roots and verify offline against explicit key rotation/revocation manifests.

- Preserve positive integer fencing counters in terminal/JSON output for workflow recovery; keep textual tokens and all other credential fields redacted.

- Publish exact evaluated Network Candidates without changing Production or standalone Agent environments. Resume/cancel durable partial preparations, reconcile original acceptance, and verify append-only publication/cancellation observations. Assistant guides require CLI 0.27+.

- Retain and hydrate exact author YAML, comments and support files through Agent/Network revision custody, with canonical source integrity and compiler verification before local storage. Legacy executable-only hydration remains supported.


## Unreleased

- Inspect/change Project lifecycle policy with YAML, explicit generation CAS and original-operation recovery. Preserve bounded ASaC gate codes on reviewed legacy promotion routes. Assistant guides require CLI 0.30+.

- Plan and apply exact evaluated Agent/Network Release selections with expected environment generation, short environment leases, immutable documentary receipts and original-operation recovery. Assistant references require CLI 0.29+.

- Add bounded Agent/Network workflow lease commands, private exact proofs on isolated Draft writes, and original-operation recovery without assuming credential reentrancy. Assistant references require CLI 0.28+.

- Publish an exact evaluated Agent Candidate, preserve original-operation reconciliation and append-only destination-scoped receipts without changing Production. Coordinate the assistant guides with CLI 0.26+.

- Prepare exact isolated Agent/Network revisions as detached immutable Candidates, inspect their state and reconcile lost acceptance without repeating writes. Native lifecycle defaults remain explicit legacy behavior.

- Recover accepted Agent/Network native bindings after cloning without private state, preserving stale generations and exact frozen constituent identities without inventing a synchronized author base or restoring credentials.

- Hydrate retained Agent/Network executable revision objects with verified receipts and bounded transfer integrity, preserving author files, bindings and working heads.

- Fetch the bounded isolated revision catalog with `history fetch --revisions`, preserving author files and the working head; validate scoped metadata without claiming object hydration.

- Validate the complete original-operation registry receipt before accepting local push/reconcile bases; retain checkpoints for incomplete or superseded evidence.

- Require CLI 0.19.1+ for the assistant payload's current ASaC guides, with upgrade guidance and coordinated verifier metadata.
- Record the compiler recipe in new author objects and verify pre-recipe source using its original lowering without rewriting hashes.
- Preserve Model endpoint overrides and their absence when lowering Provider refs; unchanged frozen Network constituents no longer gain an unintended `base_url`.

- Recover existing isolated Agent/Network Draft selection by name or UUID after a clone without private state; block unresolved writes and accidental same-origin root creation.
- Preserve incoming comment-only rebase changes and report competing comments/deletion conflicts instead of silently dropping author source.
- Exercise Agent and Network source checkpoint, exact checkout, rebase and resolved merge in the real distribution smoke on each native CI target.

- Add guarded semantic local rebase and explicit resolved-content merge checkpoints; preserve old revisions and protect newly referenced local support files.

- Add guarded local Agent/Network revision checkout with exact retained author YAML and support bytes; executable identity is checked before restore.

- Add negotiated Agent/Network isolated Draft storage with generation CAS, exact
  checkpoint registration and read-only reconciliation of uncertain writes.
- Qualify closed-package portable definition digests against shared Go/Python
  fixtures and exclude unrelated Providers from checkpoint dependencies.

- Add Agent/Network origin tracking, immutable local checkpoints and portable
  objects, explicit remote status/current reads and append-only history fetch.

- Preserve tab-indented instructions when writing local YAML descriptors by
  escaping tab-containing strings instead of emitting an unreadable literal block.

- Embed the portable skill in native CLI binaries: `woobe skill install/status/uninstall/agents`, offline without npm/Node; share receipts with the optional standalone installer.

- Add `woobe-cli-skill`, a separate npm package and explicit coding-agent skill installer.
- Support Codex, legacy `.codex`, Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, user/project scopes and custom roots.
- Preserve local edits/settings with receipts, preflight, locks and rollback.
- Include offline task references/YAML templates and six-host npm skill qualification.
- Add immutable skill release artifacts and independent, opt-in OIDC publishing.
- Refresh installation/authentication, release/CI and historical documentation boundaries.

## 0.13.7

- Recover intentionally deleted local descriptors with safe registry prune.
- Preserve referenced resources, bindings and server identities during local cleanup.

## 0.1.4

- Find draft releases by immutable ID when the published by-tag endpoint returns 404.
- Resume partial uploads and verify all remote assets before finalizing publication.

## 0.1.3

- Support Actions installation tokens whose repository metadata omits user-role permissions.
- Verify repository identity and retain authoritative GitHub write authorization.
- Show publication errors in check annotations and version tags in run titles.

## 0.1.1

- Publish the exact validated CLI to GitHub Packages (GHCR), Linux amd64/arm64.
- Gate image promotion and GitHub Release on source, digest and native smoke checks.
- Explicit version tags enable a first release without merging into master.

## 0.1.0 (distribution foundation)

- Automatic GitHub release on every master push, with immutable source identity
  and SemVer increments calculated from tags and conventional commit history.
- Reviewed source VERSION floor; no automatic source pushes or PR merges.
- Six Linux/macOS/Windows x64 and arm64 archives, schemas, notices and checksums.
- Full reusable CI gate, immutable candidate artifact ID and manifest digest,
  conflict refusal, deterministic archives and partial publication recovery.
- Verified public release and permanent manifest using built-in GITHUB_TOKEN.
- npm distribution deferred; current builds and releases have no npm dependency.
- Installation, Workspace Control Key and context setup documentation.

The existing CLI operations and functional limitations are described in
[STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md). This version does not claim completion of the full
CLI design or live acceptance of every operation.

### Exact Candidate evaluation

- Agent and Network versioned YAML suites execute frozen ready Candidates with durable operation identities, native Run evidence and read-only reconciliation. No implicit publication or Production change.
